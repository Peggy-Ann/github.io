I started two years ago when I got an Ender 3 v2 printer as a birthday present from my husband. Since then I have been printing designs that others have created and shared on thingiverse. I also managed to create som smaller and simpler stuff in Tinkercad and similar beginner software. I realize of course that Tinkercad can be a really powerful tool if you are new to this, however I found it almost to simple and the interface was not my friend. :-)

  

A couple of days before christmas I got my, long awaited, Anker M5 and I was really enthusiastic. It is blazing fast and works out of the box really well. Then I read that it is common that the M5 needs belt-adjustment before starting to use. I followed the instruktions and totally ruined my prints… :-( So I started adjusting back and got it printing again.

  

Realizing I have been tinkering for almost two years but never getting the whole way to the goal I finally decided, goaded on by my better half, that I need to learn a CAD software to really do the stuff I wanted. A bit of googling revealed that Fusion360 should be a good start.

  

I followed a tutorial on You Tube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrHuaHhqHI) After this short tutorial I was able to design and print the letter P.

  

Not a big thing maybe but from there I went on to design a shelf for my bathroomcabinet. With sockets for toothbrush, deo and some makeup stuff. I started to print.

  

I tested to print four times, between each print I cleaned and leveled the bed. I checked the settings I knew to check, everything looked good. Every time it got overextruded and created a big blob of filament on the nozzle. So I did what everyone would do…. :-) I contacted Anker support and told them of my problem with overextrusion looking for help with this.

  

While waiting for response from Anker I took a look at my slicing again added a raft to the print thinking it might help to get rid og the extra filament. When I did this I saw clearly that the raft, which is supposed to go all around the print, only encompassed one of the edges of the shelf. The design was not resting on the bed only the small shelf part was on the actual bed the rest was maybe .5 mm of the bed. I went back to my design and corrected the shelf to be a bit inside the frame. Then I got a whole new error…..

  

It seams that if the part is not on the bed and no supports it has nothing to hold onto and will bend upwards and screw up the rest of the print by "hooking" the nozzle when it passes over and moving the whole print. In the end I removed the small shelf just to se if it worked. It did.

  

Since then I have printed the whole shelf, it did not live up to my expectations the cutouts where not big enough for some of my stuff and to big for some other. But my daughter was happy she could use a shelf with different cutouts. :-)

  

Anker Support got back to me with some great instructions on how to clean up the nozzle if it has become clogged.

  

Long story short:

  

Three design do overs, seven failed prints, One contact to the support, (where there was really not an issue with the hardware) and I am still not satisfied with the result of my bathroomcabinet shelf.

  

Every time I did a print I learned something, but from this specific occasion I learned specifically: Check you work before blaming the hardware.
